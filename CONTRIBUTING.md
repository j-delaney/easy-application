# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! If you know of a company that has an easy application process please open up a pull request to add it to the list. We're looking to add more non-US companies so those are greatly appreciated. Some things to keep in mind:

* Be sure to include a link to the company's main career page (e.g. https://www.beepi.com/careers/teams rather than https://jobs.lever.co/beepi).
* Maintain alphabetical order.
* For location add each city that they company is hiring software engineers for. Cities should be separated by a semicolon and be in alphabetical order.
* If the company hires remote employees include that under location as "Remote".
* It's alright for a single commit to have multiple companies.

One goal of this repository is to keep things as simple as possible. Suggestions and feedback are always welcome and appreciated.
